    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Wonton soup is a standard of <strong>Chinese cuisine</strong> and made from seasoned chicken broth with filled wontons.
        Wontons are an Asian equivalent of <em>ravioli</em> or <em><tortellini</em> when they are folded around a spiced meat mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for ground pork as the foundation for the filling because it has great flavor and a meaty texture.
        Other meats or proteins could be substituted, such as <em>shrimp, ground chicken or turkey, or even ground beef</em>.
